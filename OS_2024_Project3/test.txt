Introduction: In recent times, there has been a notable increase in the
demand for accreditations, driven by their essential role in recognizing diplomas,
elevating the quality of higher education, facilitating student mobility, enabling
the pursuit of multiple degrees, and influencing university rankings. This surge
in demand reflects the evolving landscape of higher education in a world that is
becoming progressively interconnected and competitive.
Methods: This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for accrediting
study programs in French higher education institutions worldwide that are
seeking the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)
accreditation. ABET accreditation is a globally recognized organism of quality for
education programs in engineering, computer science, and related fields. The
methodology proposed in this paper focuses on aligning ABET’s requirements
and standards with the specific context of the French Education System (FES).
It provides clear guidelines and practical steps for higher education institutions
to effectively navigate the accreditation process. The methodology covers the
verification of existing study programs, identification of areas for improvement,
implementation of corrective actions, and continuous progress monitoring. It
emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement and aligning programs
with the Program Educational Objectives (POEs). Concrete examples and best
practices are shared to illustrate successful implementation of the methodology
developed based on the example of the engineering college programs at our
university.
Results and discussion: The results obtained in this case study demonstrate the
applicability and effectiveness of this approach within a specific educational
context. The approach presented in this contribution can serve as a model
for other countries seeking to adapt ABET accreditation requirements to their
own higher education systems, further promoting diversity and openness. This
reinforces the credibility of the methodology and paves the way for its use in
other institutions and programs that operate within similar systems.
The history of accreditation in higher education and its relation
with quality assurance (QA), particularly in the field of engineering,
can be traced back to the early 20th century when the rise of
industrialization and technological advancements led to a growing
demand for qualified engineers. In 1932, the establishment of
the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)
(ABET, 2023) in the United States marked a significant milestone
in the development of accreditation for engineering programs.
ABET was among the pioneering organizations to establish
stringent educational standards for engineering schools, ensuring
that graduates met industry requirements. This model gradually
extended its influence worldwide, leading to the creation of similar
bodies in other countries. In France, the “Commission des Titres
d’Ingénieur” (Cti) was established in 1934 (Cti, n.d.) with the
purpose of accrediting engineering education programs, thereby
ensuring their quality and compliance with educational standards.
The NAAB (National Architectural Accrediting Board), founded
in 1940 (NAAB et al., no date), is the renowned accreditation
body specialized in accrediting architectural programs in the
United States. In Germany, ASIIN “Arbeitsgemeinschaft für
Spitzentechnik, Innovation und Qualitätsmanagement in der Lehre
e.V.” (Association for Excellence in Technology, Innovation,
and Quality Management in Education), was founded in 1999
(ASIIN, no date), specializes in evaluating programs in engineering,
computer science, and natural sciences.
The Bologna Process, initiated in 1999 (Bologna Declaration,
2004; Bologna Working Group on Qualifications Frameworks,
2005), has reshaped accreditation in European higher education by
establishing common standards and promoting mutual recognition
of degrees. This has resulted in more transparent and consistent
accreditation mechanisms, thus enhancing the quality of academic
programs. Moreover, the Bologna Process has facilitated student
and researcher mobility, emphasizing the need for international
recognition of degrees and accreditation tailored to these
challenges. As a result, it has had a profound influence on the
history of accreditation in Europe by promoting the credibility
and relevance of degrees across the continent. In 2005, EUR-ACE
(European Accredited Engineer) was established as an initiative
aimed at harmonizing the accreditation of engineering programs
across Europe (Haug, 2003; EUR-ACE, 2005). This initiative was
launched in response to the need to facilitate the recognition
and mobility of engineering degrees across European borders,
thereby promoting the quality and compatibility of engineering
programs throughout the region (Augusti, 2005, 2006, 2007). EURACE is managed by the European Network for Accreditation
of Engineering Education (ENAEE) (European Association for
Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA), 2005). Its goal is
to create a European standard for the accreditation of engineering
programs (ENAEE, no date).
Accreditation in higher education is a vital process aimed
at ensuring the quality of educational institutions and academic
programs, particularly in the field of engineering (Augusti, 2005). It
allows higher education institutions to showcase their commitment
to academic excellence and compliance with established standards
and criteria (Patil and Codner, 2007). Accreditation involves a
thorough evaluation of programs, infrastructure, and available
resources to ensure that students receive a high-quality and
relevant education. In the context of engineering programs, this
validation is critical, as it guarantees that graduates possess the
skills and knowledge required to succeed in an ever-evolving
field (Patil and Codner, 2007). While it initially started as a
straightforward concept, it has evolved into a complex evaluative
tool (Young, 1983). Accreditation, or external evaluation, continues
to be a potent means of ensuring quality and can be leveraged to
enhance international recognition of educational qualifications and
professional experience (Patil, 2005), as well as to facilitate national
QA systems.
By surveying the reference frameworks of various accreditation
organizations (ASIIN, no date; ABET, 2022b; CTI, 2022), it is
observed that criteria are based on three fundamental pillars,
regardless of the accrediting body or region. The first pillar
is the student or learner, who occupies a central role in the
accreditation process. Educational programs are designed to meet
their needs and develop the necessary skills (Young, 1983; Patil,
2005). The second pillar is the program itself, which encompasses
the skills, knowledge, and pedagogical approaches aimed at
educating students. Finally, the third pillar is the school or
educational institution, which houses the first two pillars and
plays a crucial role in facilitating and overseeing the educational
process. Accreditation aims to ensure that these three pillars
work in harmony, thereby ensuring the quality of education
and preparing students for their future, especially in the field
of engineering. Accreditation standards and criteria are designed
to assess the performance of these three essential pillars. The
purposes of accreditation encompass various aspects, including
accountability to students and society, the assurance of educational
quality, the promotion of continuous program improvement, the
professional recognition of graduates, the facilitation of student
mobility, and the enhancement of institutional competitiveness
(Patil and Codner, 2007). Accreditation standards and criteria
are established based on the assessment of diverse elements
such as educational objectives, institutional resources, faculty
quality, learning infrastructure, student outcomes, governance, and
institutional responsibility. While these standards may vary from
one region to another and from one accrediting body to another,
their common objective is to ensure the quality of higher education
and address the evolving needs of society.
